UR-Hungry is a website that allows students to find events that have free food on campus. Event creators can create events in our provided form, and these events are then added to a google calendar that students can view on our website, subcribe to, and / or export events to their own calendar from.

The CalendarUpdaterScript.gs is a script that is run on the google spreadsheet that contains the form responses. To modify it for your own calendars, simply update the indicated lines in the script with your own calendar id. If you make any changes to the form itself, uncomment the indicated lines with a breakpoint on the following line and update the number variables with their new value.
