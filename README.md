UR-Hungry
=============

Project 2 for CSC 212 - Human Computer Interaction

Contributors: Becky Galasso, Charlie Henick, Samay Kapadia, Ruby Reynoso, Ethan Senator, Quanzeng You.

UR-Hungry is a website that allows students to find events with free food on campus. Users (students, faculty, or outside organizations) can create events using our provided form. These events are then added to a Google calendar that students can view on our website, subcribe to, and/or export to their own calendar from.

Go to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiOcVR5f1l0SdGMtbjQyNGJqMFN5QzZtTmNtdnBxanc&usp=sharing)  and copy it to your own drive and then edit the attached calendar updater script with your values: 

The CalendarUpdaterScript.gs is a script that is run on the Google spreadsheet that contains the form responses. To modify it for your own calendars, simply update the indicated lines in the script with your own calendar id. If you make any changes to the form itself, you should uncomment the indicated lines with a breakpoint on the following line and update the number variables with their new values.

This project was going to be hosted as a webapp using Google's app engine
